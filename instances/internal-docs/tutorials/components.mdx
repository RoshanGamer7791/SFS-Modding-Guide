# React Components

Because MDX allows you to use React components within your markdown files, you can enhance your documentation with interactive and reusable components.
The SFS Modding Guide documentation framework provides several built-in components that you can use to improve the presentation of your content.

## Using the `<Figure>` Component

The `<Figure>` component is designed to help you easily add images with captions and alt text to your documentation. Here’s how to use it:

```markdown
import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure';

<Figure
  src="/gallery/your-image-file.png"
  caption="Your image caption here"
  alt="A brief description of the image for accessibility"
  widthpercent="100"
></Figure>
```

- `src`: The path to your image file. This should be relative to the `static` directory of your documentation site.
- `caption`: A string that provides a caption for the image, displayed below it.
- `alt`: A string that describes the image for accessibility purposes. This is important for users who rely on screen readers.
- `widthpercent`: A number that sets the width of the image as a percentage of its container. For example, `100` means the image will take up the full width of its container.

## Example Usage

Here’s an example of how to include an image using the `<Figure>` component:

```markdown
import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure';

# Sample Image

<Figure
  src="/gallery/sample-image.png"
  caption="This is a sample image."
  alt="A description of the sample image for accessibility."
  widthpercent="75"
></Figure>
```

This will render the image located at `/static/gallery/sample-image.png`, with a caption below it and appropriate alt text for accessibility.
You can adjust the `widthpercent` value to control the size of the image as needed.

## Using the `ChildList` Component

The `ChildList` component automatically generates a list of child pages for the current documentation page. This is useful for creating a table of contents or navigation section within your documentation.
To use the `ChildList` component, simply import it and include it in your MDX file like this:

```markdown
import ChildList from "@site/src/components/ChildList";

## Table of Contents

<ChildList />
```

This will render a list of links to all child pages under the current page, making it easy for readers to navigate related content.

## Contribution to Components

If you have ideas for new components or improvements to existing ones, feel free to contribute! You can create your own React components and integrate them into the documentation framework.
Make sure to explain them clearly in the documentation and give a reasonable justification for their addition in your pull request.
